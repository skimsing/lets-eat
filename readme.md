# What is it?
Let's Eat is a simple recipe blogging site that I built using SQL, PHP and jQuery, for my web dev class.

# How to use this site
## Navigation
Home: Click on the links(recipe name) to see the specific details of a single recipe
Upload page: uploads a recipe to the server. Stores the steps and ingredients in MySQL as JSON (LONGTEXT)
Browse:

#### some things I spent too much time on:
* Lots of trial and error, learning and figuring out how to build a simple (and somewhat dynamic) router so that the site could be more user friendly in general, and so that processes could be more streamlined
* Coming up with regex patterns was *too much* fun
* Creating the database and tables via php should work... in theory.
